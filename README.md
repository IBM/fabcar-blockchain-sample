# FabCar Blockchain Sample

>Hyperledger Fabric sample Fabcar on IBM Blockchain Platform

> **NOTE**: This developer pattern creates a blockchain network on *IBM Blockchain Platform version **2.5*** using the *Hyperledger Fabric version **1.4***.

This code pattern demonstrates setting up a network on the IBM Blockchain Platform and deploying the Fabcar smart contract on the network.  Next, we setup our application to interact with the network including identities to submit transactions on the smart contract.  The application is setup with a Node.js server using the Fabric Node SDK to process requests to the network, and an Angular client to bring up a web interface.

 When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to:

* Setup a Hyperledger Fabric network on IBM Blockchain Platform
* Install and instantiate smart contract through the IBM Blockchain Platform
* Develop a Node.js server with the Hyperledger Fabric SDK to interact with the deployed network
* Create an Angular frontend for the web app to interface with the network


## Architecture flow

</p>

1. The Blockchain Operator sets up the IBM Blockchain Platform service.
2. The IBM Blockchain Platform enables to create a Hyperledger Fabric network onto a IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, allowing to install and instantiate the Fabcar smart contract on the network.
3. The Node.js application server uses the Fabric SDK to interact with the deployed network on IBM Blockchain Platform and creates APIs for a web client.
4. The Angular client uses the Node.js application API to interact with the network.
5. The User interacts with the Fabcar Angular web interface to update and query the blockchain ledger and state.

## Running the application

Follow these steps to set up and run this code pattern. The steps are described in detail below.


## Steps

> To run a local network, you can find steps [here](./run-local.md)

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Package the smart contract](#2-package-the-smart-contract)
3. [Create IBM Cloud services](#3-create-ibm-cloud-services)
4. [Build a network](#4-build-a-network)
5. [Deploy FabCar Smart Contract on the network](#5-deploy-fabcar-smart-contract-on-the-network)
6. [Connect application to the network](#6-connect-application-to-the-network)
7. [Run the application](#7-run-the-application)


### 1. Clone the repo

Clone this repository in a folder your choice:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/fabcar-blockchain-sample.git
cd fabcar-blockchain-sample
```

### 2. Package the smart contract

We will use the IBM Blockchain Platform extension on VS Code to package the Fabcar smart contract.

* Open Visual Studio code and open the `contract` folder from `fabcar-blockchain-sample` repository that was cloned earlier. 
   **It is important that you are opening the `contract` folder and not the entire `fabcar-blockchain-sample` directory; otherwise you will see an error that states that it doesn't understand what programming language you are using.**

* Press the `F1` key to see the different VS code options. Choose `IBM Blockchain Platform: Package Open Project`.

<p align="center">

</p>

* Click the `IBM Blockchain Platform` extension button on the left. This will show the packaged contracts on top and the blockchain connections on the bottom.

<p align="center">
  <img height="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/73010107-bdd3d800-3ddf-11ea-8505-aff152d604e4.png">
</p>

* Next, right click on the packaged contract (in this case, select fabcar@1.0.0) to export it and choose `Export Package`.

* Choose a location on your machine and save the `.cds` file. We will use this packaged smart contract later to deploy on the IBM Blockchain Platform service.

Now, we will start setting up the different services required for configuring our Hyperledger Fabric network on the IBM Cloud and for running our application using this network.


### 3. Create IBM Cloud services

* Create the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/cluster). You can find the service in the `Catalog`. For this code pattern, we can use the `Free` cluster, and give it a name. Note, that the IBM Cloud allows one instance of a free cluster which expires after 30 days. **Note: it could take 20 minutes for the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service setup to complete**.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/71910506-046ad680-3140-11ea-9f4b-8bcb4d2a651b.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Create the [IBM Blockchain Platform](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/blockchain-platform) service on the IBM Cloud. You can find the service in the `Catalog`, and give it a name.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/71910502-046ad680-3140-11ea-9853-3598b9363d91.gif">
</p>
<br>

* After your kubernetes cluster is up and running, you can deploy your IBM Blockchain Platform on the cluster. Again - wait for the IBM Cloud Kubernetes service to indicate it was deployed. The IBM Blockchain Platform service walks through few steps and finds your cluster on the IBM Cloud to deploy the service on.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/71910501-046ad680-3140-11ea-8440-9d2fef0be426.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Once the Blockchain Platform is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster, you can launch the console to start configuring your blockchain network.


### 4. Build a network

We will build a network as provided by the IBM Blockchain Platform [documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/blockchain/howto?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network#ibp-console-build-network).

</p>
<br>


#### Update application connection profile

  - Copy the connection profile you downloaded into the [server folder](web-app/server).
  - Update the [config.json](web-app/server/config.json) file with:
    - The connection json file name you downloaded.
    - The <b>enroll id</b> and <b>enroll secret</b> for your app admin, which we earlier provided as `app-admin` and `app-adminpw` respectively.
    - The orgMSP ID, which we provided as `Org1MSP`.
    - The caName, which can be found in your connection json file under "organizations" -> "Org1MSP" -> certificateAuthorities". This would be like an IP address and a port.
    - The username you would like to register.
    - Update gateway discovery to `{ enabled: true, asLocalhost: false }` to connect to IBM Blockchain Platform.

> <b>the current default contents of the config.json are to connect to a local fabric instance from VS Code.</b>

After the updates, the contents of the config.json should look similar to the file shown below:
```
{
    "connection_file": "Org1MSP_profile.json",
    "appAdmin": "app-admin",
    "appAdminSecret": "app-adminpw",
    "orgMSPID": "Org1MSP",
    "caName": "169.46.208.151:30404",
    "userName": "user1",
    "gatewayDiscovery": { "enabled": true, "asLocalhost": false }
}
```


### 7. Run the application

#### Enroll admin

  - First, navigate to the `web-app/server` directory, and install the node dependencies:
    
    ```bash
    cd web-app/server
    npm install
    ```

  - Run the `enrollAdmin.js` script:
    
    ```bash
    node enrollAdmin.js
    ```

  - You should see the following in the terminal:
    
    ```bash
    msg: Successfully enrolled admin user app-admin and imported it into the wallet
    ```


#### Register User

  - From the `server` directory, run the `registerUser.js` script:
    
    ```bash
    node registerUser.js
    ```

  - You should see the following in the terminal:
    
    ```bash
    Successfully registered and enrolled admin user user1 and imported it into the wallet
    ```

#### Deregister User

**NOTE: The following steps need to be performed only if you wish to revoke an existing user.**

By default, removal of identities is disabled in IBM Blockchain Platform. If you wish to remove identities, you need to manually override this default setting in the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

  - On the console, go to the `Nodes` tab using the left hand navigation pane and click on your organization's CA.
  - Click on the settings icon in the left side.
  - In the pane that opens up on the right side, click on `Edit configuration JSON (Advanced)`.
  - Paste the following into the input block for `Configuration updates`, then click `Update Certificate Authority`.
  **NOTE: The value of 10 for passwordattempts is the default value. If your certificate authority was set up with a different number for passwordattempts then you need to use that number. You can find this value from the `Current configuration` section which is just above the `Configuration updates` section.**

  ```json
  {
    "ca": {	
      "cfg": {
      "identities": {
        "passwordattempts": 10,
        "allowremove": true	
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

<br>
<p align="center">

The removal of identities will now be enabled. As long as your application admin has been created with the `hf.Revoker` attribute set to the value of `true` (as specified in the [Create an application admin](#-create-an-application-admin) step above, you can use the `deregisterUser.js` script to remove the user identity.

  - From the `server` directory, run the `deregisterUser.js` script. This script removes/revokes the user identified by `userName` specified in the [config.json](web-app/server/config.json) file.
    
    ```bash
    node deregisterUser.js
    ```

  - You should see the following in the terminal:
    
    ```bash
    Successfully deregistered the user user1 and deleted it from the wallet.
    ```


#### Start the application server

  - From the `server` directory, start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```


#### Start the web client

  - In a new terminal, open the `web-app/client` directory and install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd web-app/client
    npm install
    ```

  - Start the client:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

You can find the app running at http://localhost:4200/

## Troubleshooting

* If you encounter an error ``discover error: access denied``, you need to set the `gatewayDiscovery` properly in your `config.json` file. This is <b>REQUIRED</b>  You must set it as follows to connect to IBP:

                 `"gatewayDiscovery": {"enabled": true, "asLocalhost": false }`

* When running the *registerUser.js* script, if you get an error that says `Failed to register user user1: TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "options.ca" property must be one of type string, Buffer, TypedArray, or DataView. Received type object` , you can get past this error by editing your connection profile that was downloaded from IBM Blockchain Platform. Open the connection profile and look for `tlsCACerts` under your certificateAuthority. If the `pem` value under `tlsCACerts` is of type array, remove the square brackets `[]` and convert it to a string. That is, if your connection profile is like the following image:

</p>

update it as shown in the image below:

</p>

* When running the *registerUser.js* script, if you get an error that says `Error: Calling register endpoint failed with error [Error: self signed certificate]`, you can get past this by adding `"httpOptions": {"verify": false}` to the certificateAuthorities section of the connection profile that was downloaded from IBM Blockchain Platform.

* WHen running the *deregisterUser.js script, if you get an error that says `[[{"code":56,"message":"Identity removal is disabled"}]]`, this is because identity removal is disabled by default in IBM Blockchain Platform. You will have to enable it by updating the CA using the steps provided in the [Deregister User](#-deregister-user) section above.

* When running the *deregisterUser.js* script, if you get an error that says `Failed to deregister user user1: Error: fabric-ca request revoke failed with errors [[{"code":71,"message":"Authorization failure"}]]`, this is because your application admin does not have the `hf.Revoker` attribute set to `true`. You will need to add a new application admin with this attribute, enroll the admin using the enroll.js script and then you should be able to run the deregisterUser.js script using this new application admin.
