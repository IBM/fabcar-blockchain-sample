# FabCar Blockchain Sample

>Hyperledger Fabric sample Fabcar on IBM Blockchain Platform

This code pattern demonstrates setting up a network on the IBM Blockchain Platform and deploying the Fabcar smart contract on the network.  Next, we setup our application to interact with the network including identities to submit transactions on the smart contract.  The application is setup with a Node.js server using the Fabric Node SDK to process requests to the network, and an Angular client to bring up a web interface.

 When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to:

* Setup a Hyperledger Fabric network on IBM Blockchain Platform
* Install and instantiate smart contract through the IBM Blockchain Platform
* Develop a Node.js server with the Hyperledger Fabric SDK to interact with the deployed network
* Create an Angular frontend for the web app to interface with the network


# Architecture flow

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-images/arch-flow.png">
</p>

The developer uses the IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VS Code to:

1. The Blockchain Operator sets up the IBM Blockchain Platform service
2. The IBM Blockchain Platform enables to create a Hyperledger Fabric network onto a IBM Kubernetes Service, allowing to install and instantiate the Fabcar smart contract on the network
3. The Node.js application server uses the Fabric sdk to interact with the deployed network on IBM Blockchain Platform and creates APIs for a web client
4. The Angular client uses the Node.js application API to interact with the network
5. The User interacts with the Fabcar Angular web interface to update and query the blockchain ledger and state

## Running the application

Follow these steps to set up and run this code pattern. The steps are described in detail below.

### Steps

> To run a local network, you can find steps [here](./docs/run-local.md)

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Package the smart contract](#2-package-the-smart-contract)
3. [Create IBM Cloud services](#3-create-ibm-cloud-services)
4. [Build a network](#4-build-a-network)
5. [Deploy FabCar Smart Contract on the network](#5-deploy-fabcar-smart-contract-on-the-network)
6. [Connect application to the network](#6-connect-application-to-the-network)
7. [Run the application](#7-run-the-application)


## 1. Clone the repo

Clone this repository in a folder your choice:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/fabcar-blockchain-sample.git
cd fabcar-blockchain-sample
```

## 2. Package the smart contract

We will use the IBM Blockchain Platform extension to package the Fabcar smart contract.
* Open Visual Studio code and open the `contract` folder from this repository that was cloned earlier.

* Press the `F1` key to see the different VS code options. Choose `IBM Blockchain Platform: Package a Smart Contract Project`.

* Click the `IBM Blockchain Platform` extension button on the left. This will show the packaged contracts on top and the blockchain connections on the bottom.

* Next, right click on the packaged contract to export it and choose `Export Package`.

* Choose a location on your machine and save `.cds` file.  We will use this packages smart contract later to deploy on our work.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/package-smart-contract.gif">
</p>

Now, we will start creating our Hyperledger Fabric network on the IBM Cloud.

## 3. Create IBM Cloud services

* Create the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/infrastructure/containers-kubernetes).  You can find the service in the `Catalog`.  For this code pattern, we can use the `Free` cluster, and give it a name.  Note, that the IBM Cloud allows one instance of a free cluster and expires after 30 days.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/create-ibm-kubernetes-service.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Create the [IBM Blockchain Platform](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/blockchain/) service on the IBM Cloud.  You can find the service in the `Catalog`, and give a name.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/create-ibm-blockchain-2-service.gif">
</p>
<br>

* After your kubernetes cluster is up and running, you can deploy your IBM Blockchain Platform on the cluster.  The service walks through few steps and finds your cluster on the IBM Cloud to deploy the service on.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/deployblockchainservice.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Once the Blockchain Platform is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster, you can launch the console to start operating on your blockchain network.

<br>

* #### Update application connection
  - Copy the connection profile you downloaded into [server folder](web-app/server)
  - Update the [config.json](web-app/server/config.json) file with:
    - The connection json file name you downloaded.
    - The <b>enroll id</b> and <b>enroll secret</b> for your app admin, which we earlier provided as `app-admin` and `app-adminpw`.
    - The orgMSP ID, which we provided as `org1msp`.
    - The caName, which can be found in your connection json file under "organization" -> "org1msp" -> certificateAuthorities". This would be like an IP address and a port.
    - The username you would like to register.
    - Update gateway discovery to `{ enabled: true, asLocalhost: false }` to connect to IBP.

> the current default setup is to connect to a local fabric instance from VS Code

```js
{
    "connection_file": "mychannel_fabcar_profile.json",
    "appAdmin": "app-admin",
    "appAdminSecret": "app-adminpw",
    "orgMSPID": "org1msp",
    "caName": "169.46.208.151:30404",
    "userName": "user1",
    "gatewayDiscovery": { "enabled": true, "asLocalhost": false }
}
```


## 7. Run the application

* #### Enroll admin
  - First, navigate to the `web-app` directory, and install the node dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd web-app/server
    npm install
    ```

  - Run the `enrollAdmin.js` script
    ```bash
    node enrollAdmin.js
    ```

  - You should see the following in the terminal:
    ```bash
    msg: Successfully enrolled admin user app-admin and imported it into the wallet
    ```

* #### Register User
  - Run the `registerUser.js` script.
    ```bash
    node registerUser.js
    ```

  - You should see the following in the terminal:
    ```bash
    Successfully registered and enrolled admin user user1 and imported it into the wallet
    ```



* #### Start the application server
  - From the `server` directory, start the server.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

* #### Start the web client
  - In a new terminal, open the web client folder and install the dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd web-app/client
    npm install
    ```

  - Start the client:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

You can find the app running at http://localhost:4200/

<br>
<p align="center">

</p>
<br>


## Troubleshooting
* If you encounter an error ``discover error: access denied``, you need to set the `gatewayDiscovery` properly in your `config.json` file. This is <b>REQUIRED</b>  You must set it as follows to connect to IBP:

                 `"gatewayDiscovery": {"enabled": true, "asLocalhost": false }`
